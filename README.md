# target-template
Target templates for AfriHackBox content creators.

This is a collection of templates to assist with creating targets and challenges for the AfriHackBox platform.


Some general rules you need to follow when creating your target or challenge:
* No `VOLUME` and `PORTS` statements are allowed
* Target names must be alphanumeric, with no spaces or capital letters
* All targets and challenges must include a detailed solution writeup
* All external documentation for the target or challenge must be in markdown format
* You must have solved at least 5 of our existing machines (not counting SanityCheck) for your target/challenge to be accepted
* If you don't use our templates then you need to make sure that you include the `variables.yml` and `autoregister.yml` files and ensure that they run during build
